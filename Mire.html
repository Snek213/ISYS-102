        There was once a human wizard his name lost to time, one that had fought many battles and studied the arcane for nearly a century.
        Looking for a way to prolong his life finding hope in the dark power of a patron, a devil, thus he strikes a contract with Asheth. 
        Try as he did to use this power to stave off his inevitable end, he failed. When his life ended, Asheth appeared to reap her reward. 
        As she used her magic, a containing what looked like a dark-green gelatinous goo glowed and reacted to the power. 
        She could feel her power being pulled; not like it was being stolen, but as if it was a rope being fused to another by a flame. 
        The Ooze shifted and poured out of the side of the barrel slowly assimilating taking a humanoid shape as it stared Asheth.
        The normally stoic demon looked confused as the creature gave a blank stare. “Hello?...” she ask inquisitively confused about what 
        it was and the nature of its magic. Its magic felt ingrained with hers similar to the contracts shes so familiar with, yet it was different. 
        It didn’t feel like a giving of power, from either party but more of a mutual control. With all these thoughts going through her the 
        Ooze still didn’t change, the absence of a face making discerning its emotion impossible. 
        Asheth had have the thought to leave the creature but she didn’t know what it was doing to her and she didn’t feel it best to leave it 
        to roam free. “Fine…” she sighed “I suppose ill have to take you back.” The creature then started to shift, and laid by Asheths like a pup 
        would lie by its mother. Asheth felt a strange familiarity with the creature, an emotion. she couldn’t quiet place washed over her telling her
        to protect the creature. 
        (This is kind of where I’m burnt out on writing for now plus I don’t want to make you read a bunch so…bleh, the rest is summarized)
        Asheth would take the Ooze back to her home and name him Mire. She would raise him growing less and less involved in the activities of a 
        patron favoring the time she spent with her newly found family. She saw his talents and trained them and taught them what she could. 
        But after 40+ plus years she realized this life was too small for them. She convinced Mire with their boundless personality until he learns 
        more of the world and she gives him a mask that had the symbol that was boldly displayed on the side of the house. 
        She tells him that one day when he see the world and grabs hold of all of his potential, hell be able to come back 
        (aka when they are high level and get planar shift or some shit lol).
